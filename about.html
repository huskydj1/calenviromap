    <h1>About</h1>
    <div>
      <p class="about-us-paragraph">
        With six in ten Californians <a href="http://www.ppic.org/publication/ppic-statewide-survey-californians-and-the-environment-july-2021/">“very concerned about more-severe droughts and wildfires as a result of climate-change,”</a> the environmental movement has moved from its conservationist roots to organizing around climate change. However, despite the movements’ growth in size and scope, concerns still remain that the movement is run primarily by lawyers, economists, and ecologists who have little experience or understanding of the lives of the people who are most impacted. 
      </p>
      <p class="about-us-paragraph">
        One attempt to address this issue has been to utilize recent advancements in technology for gathering and analyzing data, in order to better understand the disproportionate burdens upon different communities. CalEnviroScreen, a screening methodology by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, has been one such project. However, despite its well intentions, the quantitative data–driven approach of CalEnviroScreen has not been without issue. Primarily, critics have pointed out that 1) <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/1289559">census tracts don’t accurately represent communities</a> 2) <a href="http://scholarworks.calstate.edu/downloads/sj139437f">the indicators don’t capture the lived experiences</a> and 3) <a href="http://scholarworks.calstate.edu/downloads/sj139437f">the statistical model doesn’t capture the intricate dynamics of the indicators</a>. 
      </p>
      <p class="about-us-paragraph">
        CalEnviroMap attempts to alleviate these issues by providing a platform to debate and share both quantitative and qualitative data. In particular, the feed wall will constantly show recent tweets relevant to climate change in California. The maps section will allow people to weigh in on relevant indicators, statistical models, and portray what they believe is the most accurate quantitative approach to assessing climate impact. The experiences section will allow anyone to post their lived experiences in their specific location, prompting both geographical and experiential understanding. In these ways, CalEnviroMap hopes to promote discussion on the best ways of tackling environmental justice and disproportionate climate impact.
